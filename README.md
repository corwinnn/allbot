# HugiBot

It's a telegram bot that allows you to tag all cghat members and to create aliases for subgroups and tag them by the alias.

**@every0ne_listen_bot**

## What can I do?
* `/help` - show help message
* `/all` or `@all` - tag all known chat members
* `/add` - add people manually for tagging them with /all after
* `/group` - add alias for a group. For example, you'll be able to tag all boys in the chat by `@boys`, and all girls by `@girls`
* `/info` - learn about current known members and aliases
