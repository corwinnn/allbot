Hi! I want to help you to tag your friends in group chats.\n\n
/all or @all - I'll tag all known members of the chat (I know members that have written something  in chat after the moment I've come
to the chat or people that were added by /add command.\n\n
/add - add people manually\n\n
/group - add alias for a group. For example, you'll be able to call all boys in the chat by @boys, and all girls by @girls\n\n
/info - learn about current known members and aliases\n\n
For —Åomplaints and suggestions - write to @MikeHeller\n\n
